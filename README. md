# ChatNBX Fine-tuning Script

This Bash script facilitates the process of fine-tuning the ChatNBX (Tune Chat API) by generating a dataset of questions and answers in JSON format. It reads questions from a specified file, prompts the user for answers, and saves the dialogue history in a JSON file for training purposes.

## Features

- **Automatic Questioning:** The script automatically asks questions from a designated file and awaits user responses.
- **JSON Output:** Dialogue history is saved in a JSON format suitable for fine-tuning ChatNBX.
- **Resumable:** If interrupted, the script resumes asking questions where it left off.
- **Easy Exit:** Users can type 'e' to exit the questioning process at any time.

## Prerequisites

- **Bash**: The script is designed to run on a Bash shell environment.
- **Text File with Questions**: Prepare a text file containing the questions you want to ask. Each question should be on a separate line.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Questions**: Ensure your questions are listed in a text file (e.g., `questions.txt`), with one question per line.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the script in your terminal. The script will prompt you with each question and wait for your response.
3. **Provide Answers**: Input your answers to the prompted questions. To exit the script, simply type 'e'.
4. **View Output**: The dialogue history is saved in `chat_hist.json`, ready for use in fine-tuning ChatNBX.

## Example

```bash
./Create_Chat_History.sh
